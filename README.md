# WoM-Presentation-I

So, the entire purpose of this repository is an assignment that someone may be lucky(or unlucky) in receiving when he makes his first presentation for
the Writing of Mathematics course at ISI Bangalore. Hopefully, this is a fair guideline of what I tried to do for my first project. Hopefully, it helps you
draw some inspiration for your own presentation.

The repository mainly includes:
1) The TeX file for the presentation and the pdf.
2) A C program to approximate a result.
3) CSV data sheets which contain every outcome, probabilities for each experiment, averages and standard deviations.
